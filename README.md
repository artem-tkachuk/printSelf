My teacher assigned me to write a program that prints itself. At first, I thought there should be a neat trick somewhere but it turned out to be 5 lines in my first attempt and then I pervertedly reduced it to 1 line in the second. Is this all you are capable of, teacher?? 

Kidding. He did not mention that it should not use files and stuff, so my one liner solve the STATED problem correctly. Now it's time to think about a real Quine implementation.
